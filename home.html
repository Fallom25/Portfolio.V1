      <p>A bunch of stuff about me ... and now some gibberish until I write this section...
        I now realise that I must relax a bit and try and let the report come along I don’t need to try and get everyone to go at the same pace as me. 
        I need to meditate more, allowing me to no get overwhelmed with the number of things I must do. 
        I was surprised at the amount of teamwork and comradery that happened when we were getting ready to submit the draft. 
        I was surprised at how different everyone’s experience to report writing and everyone’s background knowledge that they can input into the assignment. 
        Looking back on the past nine weeks I have been trying to reflect on myself and the privileges that I have in this trying time. 
        I intend to try and be more of the collaborator of the group instead of trying to steer the outcomes of our meetings. 
        My confidence in my ability is always fluctuating. 
        When I’m working on something that I want to do well in or involves skills that that I want to do well in I don’t seem to have any trouble trying and failing and trying again. 
        When I’m working on something that I perceive I will never be good at no matter how much effort I put in it takes me such a long time to grasp concepts and I give up much easier. 
        Our design even our design task has changed quite a bit since we first started working on the design. 
        The part above our design that I really like is that we all worked together and each one of us brought ideas to collaborate on the design. 
        When we weren’t sure about one solution, we all talked through it as a team to decide where to go next. 
        We also did this when editing out draft before submission which I think brought us close together as a team as everyone could have their ideas heard. </p>
